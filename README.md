# TTN gateway map
While using the TTN tracker application for some time now on my home-made LoPy tracker it shows that signals were recorded by at least 246 different gateways in the Dutch area. This raised a question: How many more did not yet receive my tracker, where are they located and which would be the easiest to drive by?
This Node-Red flow logs data from the tracker and plots gateways seen and unseen on a map.

Prequisits:
- node-red-contrib-ttn installed
- node-red-contrib-web-worldmap installed
